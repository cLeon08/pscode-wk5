// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

create variable to hold number, num1

ask user for a whole number
store number into variable created

if num1 modulus(%) 2 is equal to 0, num1 is even
else, num1 is odd.

print to the user, the number you entered is...(even or odd)

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.
create the variables to hold the numbers, num1-5
using a loop, ask the user for the 5 numbers
store the numbers into the variables
   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
create the variable to hold the sum of the given numbers, sum
create the variable to hold the average, avg

add the numbers given from the user together and store into sum, num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5 = sum

divide sum by the amount of numbers and store into avg, avg = sum / 5

print to the user the average of the  numbers you gave is...(avg)
